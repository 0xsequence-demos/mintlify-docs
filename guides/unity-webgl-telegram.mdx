sidebarTitle: Build a Telegram Mini-Game in Unity
---

This guide will walk you through setting up your Telegram Mini-app or game using Sequence's Unity SDK, enabling web3
functionality on EVM chains for your users, for email and guest authentication methods.

We’ll develop the game logic in Unity, but to deploy it as a Telegram Mini-Game, we’ll package the WebGL
build within a React project.

## Setup your Telegram Bot

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Telegram Bot with BotFather">

1. Open Telegram and search for "@BotFather"
2. Start a conversation by clicking "Start" or typing `/start`
3. Create a new bot by typing `/newbot`
4. Follow the prompts:
- Enter a name for your bot
- Choose a username (must end in 'bot')

</Step>
<Step title="Obtain Required Tokens">

After creating your bot, BotFather will provide:
- Bot Token (HTTP API Token)
- Bot Username

Save these credentials - you'll need them for the next steps.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Prepare your Unity WebGL Project

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Sequence's Unity SDK">

Use one of our [recommend installation options](/sdk/unity/installation) for your existing project or use our
[Unity Boilerplate](https://github.com/0xsequence/unity-embedded-wallet-boilerplate) if you want to start a project from scratch.

</Step>
<Step title="UI for Mobile Layouts">

Ensure that your game's UI is optimized for mobile aspect ratios. We recommend using the
[Device Simulator for Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/device-simulator.html).
Additionally, ensure your input handling is set up for touch controls.

</Step>
<Step title="Configure Sequence's React Template for WebGL">

Sequence's Unity SDK includes a WebGL Template for exporting as a React project.
Copy the `WebGLTemplates` folder from `Packages/Sequence Embedded Wallet SDK/` into your project's `Assets/` directory.
Go to `Project Settings` -> `Player` -> `WebGL` -> `Resolution and Presentation` and select the `SequenceReact` template.

</Step>
<Step title="Cloudflare Configuration">

Inside the React project's root directory, create a `wrangler.toml` file and include the following content.

```shell
name = "telegrambot"
compatibility_date = "2024-03-25"
pages_build_output_dir = "./dist"
[vars]
BOT_TOKEN = "GET_YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_FROM_BOTFATHER"
BOT_SECRET = "can_be_any_long_random_string_abc123_do_not_share"

[dev]
port = 4444
```

</Step>
<Step title="Build your WebGL game as a React project">

Open the root directory of your React project in a CLI or an IDE like Visual Studio Code, and run the following
command to test your game in the browser.

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Deploy your Telegram Mini-Game

<Steps>
<Step title="Authenticate with Cloudflare Account">
From the React project's root directory, deploy the app and functions logic to Cloudflare.

1. Run `pnpm wrangler pages deploy`

This will prompt you to authenticate with Cloudflare if not already logged in. On successful deploy,
copy the URL where your application is now hosted.

</Step>
<Step title="Register Webhook with Telegram">

Now we call our `registerWebhook` endpoint on our app to register the webhook function with the URL of your deployed
application to enable access for the Telegram API.

```shell
curl -X POST \
     "<YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYED_URL>/api/registerWebhook"
```

</Step>
<Step title="Update Allowed Origins">
Ensure in [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/project/default/embedded-wallet) that your wallet configuration includes the URL of your deployed application
as an allowed origin.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Test out your Telegram Game!
Send a message to your bot on Telegram and check if it responds! It should answer you with the ability to share,
play or get more information about the bot.
