title: Bootstrap your Game
description: Documentation for Unity SDK setup for the Sequence infrastructure stack for web3 gaming.
---

Sequence's Unity SDK includes a range of features to help you bootstrap your game.
You can create them as shown below or duplicate the `.prefab` files from the
`Packages > Sequence Embedded Wallet SDK > Sequence > SequenceBoilerplates > Prefabs`
folder and customize them to fit your needs.

Ensure that your codebase has access to the `Sequence.Boilerplates.asmdef` assembly.

Checkout the `BoilerplateController.cs` for more integration examples.

## Login

Create the `SequenceLoginWindow` prefab to authenticate users as a Guest, with Email OTP, Google- or Apple Sign In.

[Checkout the Authentication section](/sdk/unity/authentication/intro) for more details on how to configure
your project for each login option.

show an In-Game Shop that utilizes game items from a ERC1155 contract, which users purchase using any custom or
existing ERC20 currency.
