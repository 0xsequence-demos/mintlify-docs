title: Smart Contracts
---

Creating a `Contract` object for an already deployed contract is rather straightforward.

```csharp
Contract contract = new Contract(contractAddress, abi);
```
While it is not strictly required, it is <i>highly</i> recommended to provide the contract ABI as a string when creating a contract object. Failure to do so will make it so that you cannot fully take advantage of our ABI encoding and decoding.
If you do chose to go down this route, you will need to provide the entire function signature (function name + parameter types in brackets - e.g. transfer(address,uint256) for the ERC20 transfer method) when calling a function or querying the contract and you will only ever receive a string as a response to queries.

## Calling Smart Contract Functions

To call a smart contract, you'll use the `CallFunction` method to create a `CallContractFunction` object which will determine the appropriate gasPrice, gasLimit, nonce, and data to include in a newly assembled `EthTransaction` when provided with a client and a `ContractCall` object to the `Create` async Task

An example of calling a smart contract would look like:
```csharp
Contract erc20Contract = new Contract(contractAddress, contractAbi); // We'll use the well-known ERC20 contract as our example case
TransactionReceipt receipt = await erc20Contract.CallFunction("transfer", toAddress, amountAsBigInteger).SendTransactionMethodAndWaitForReceipt(wallet, client);
```
Note: if you don't want to wait for the receipt, you can use `SendTransactionMethod` instead.

Alternatively, if you want to simply create the `EthTransaction` and send it at a later time, you can use the `CallContractFunction` object from `CallFunction` directly.
```csharp
Contract erc20Contract = new Contract(contractAddress, contractAbi); // We'll use the well-known ERC20 contract as our example case
EthTransaction transaction = await erc20Contract.CallFunction("transfer", toAddress, amountAsBigInteger).Create(client, new ContractCall(wallet.GetAddress()));
TransactionReceipt receipt = await wallet.SendTransactionAndWaitForReceipt(client, transaction);

// or 
CallContractFunction transactionCreator = erc20Contract.CallFunction("transfer", toAddress, amountAsBigInteger);
EthTransaction transaction = await transactionCreator.Create(client, new ContractCall(wallet.GetAddress()));
TransactionReceipt receipt = await wallet.SendTransactionAndWaitForReceipt(client, transaction);

// or 
CallContractFunction transactionCreator = erc20Contract.CallFunction("transfer", toAddress, amountAsBigInteger);
TransactionReceipt receipt = await transactionCreator.SendTransactionMethodAndWaitForReceipt(wallet, client);
```

You'll notice that the `CallFunction` method accepts an arbitrary number of arguments. You'll want to provide the arguments in the order they are provided in the ABI/function signature.

## Understanding Data Type Mappings

When interacting with smart contracts, it is important to understand how EVM datatypes are mapped to C# datatypes in the SequenceEthereum library.

If you were to, for example, provide a string where the ABI expects an Integer, you will receive an exception, even if that string could be converted into an integer.

### Address

In C# you can either use a `string` type or create an instance of `Address`. Ensure that your string is a hexadecimal
string starting with `0x` and a fixed length of 42 characters.

```csharp
Address address = new Address("0x123...");
```

### Integers

For integer types such as `int256`, `uint8`, or `uint256` you use the `BigInteger` type from System.Numerics.

```csharp
// Simple number
BigInteger number = new BigInteger(10000);

// From hex
string hexString = "0x0000000...01";
BigInteger number = hexString.HexStringToBigInteger();
```

### Bytes

To define byte data types from Solidity in C#, you have the options to create a `FixedByte` for types such as `byte16` or `byte32`.
When your contract requires `bytes` you can convert any value into a `byte[]` of any length.

If your data is represented as a hex string in C#, make sure to use our `HexStringToByteArray()` function to convert
the hex value back to the original byte array.

For byte arrays such as `byte32[]`, you simply create a `FixedByte[]` in C#.

```csharp
// byte16 or byte32
new FixedByte(16, new byte[] {});

// bytes
string someString = "abc0123456789";
byte[] bytes = someString.ToByteArray();

// signature
string signature = "0x0ab123...";
byte[] bytes = signature.HexStringToByteArray();
```

### Structs

You use Tuples to call an on-chain function with a struct. Here is an example Solidity struct and how to define it
using Sequence's Unity SDK and pass it as an arg in a `Contract.CallFunction` function.

Solidity Struct
```solidity
struct ExampleStruct {
    address wallet;
    uint256 amount;
    byte32 data;
}
```

C# Equivalent
```csharp
Address wallet = new Address("0x...");
BigInteger amount = new BigInteger(10000);
FixedByte data = new FixedByte(32, byteArrayData);
var arg = new Tuple<Address, BigInteger, FixedByte>(wallet, amount, data);
```

### Other Types

For traditional data types in Solidity like `string` or `bool`, you can use the same data types in C#.

## Querying Contracts

To query a smart contract (read data from it), you'll use the `SendQuery<T>` method to query the contract and return the result as type T (if possible).
An example of querying a smart contract would look like:
```csharp
Contract erc20Contract = new Contract(contractAddress, contractAbi); // We'll use the well-known ERC20 contract as our example case
BigIntegar balance = await erc20Contract.SendQuery<BigIntegar>(client, "balanceOf", address);
```

Alternatively, if you wish to simply construct the query and send it at a later time, you can use `QueryContract<T>` to create a delegate.
```csharp
Contract erc20Contract = new Contract(contractAddress, contractAbi); // We'll use the well-known ERC20 contract as our example case
QueryContractMessageSender<BigIntegar> balanceQuery = erc20Contract.QueryContract<BigIntegar>("balanceOf", address);
BigIntegar balance = await balanceQuery(client);
// or
BigIntegar balance = await balanceQuery.SendQuery(client);
```

## Deploying Contracts

If you want to deploy a contract, you can use the `ContractDeployer`

```csharp
ContractDeploymentResult deploymentResult = await ContractDeployer.Deploy(client, wallet, contractBytecodeAsString);
string newlyDeployedContractAddress = deploymentResult.Receipt.contractAddress;
```
